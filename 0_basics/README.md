Step 0: Become familiar with Rust basics
========================================

Read through [Rust Book], [Rust FAQ], and become familiar with basic [Rust] concepts, syntax, memory model, type and module systems.

Polish your familiarity by completing [Rust By Example].

Read through [Cargo Book] and become familiar with [Cargo].

After completing these steps, you should be able to answer (and understand why) the following questions:
- What memory model [Rust] has? Is it single-threaded or multiple-threaded? Is it synchronous or asynchronous?
- What runtime [Rust] has? Does it use GC (garbage collector)?
- What statically typing means? What is the benefit of using it?
- What are generics and parametric polymorphism? What problem do they solve?
- What is the crate and what is the module in Rust? How do they differ? How are the used?
- What are move semantics? What are borrowing rules? What is the benefit of using them?
- What is immutability? What is the benefit of using it?
- What is an iterator? What is a collection? How do they differ? How are they used?
- What are traits? What do the allow?
- What is RAII? How is it implemented in [Rust]? What is the benefit of using it?
- What are macroses? What problems do the solve?
- How code is tested in [Rust]? Where should you put tests and why?
- Why [Rust] has `&str` and `String` types? How do the differ? When you should them?
- What are lifetimes? What problem do they solve? What benefits do they give?
- Is [Rust] OOP language? Is it possible to use SOLID/GRASP? Does it have inheritance?

Notify your lead in related MR when you're done, and he will exam what you have learned.
