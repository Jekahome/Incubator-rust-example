>>>
It wasnâ€™t always so clear, but the Rust programming language is fundamentally about _empowerment_: no matter what kind of code you are writing now, Rust empowers you to reach farther, to program with confidence in a wider variety of domains than you did before.

This project represents a step-by-step [Rust] learning course from language basics to production use.




## Prerequisites


### Toolchain

- [rustup] for installing [Rust] toolchain and keeping it up-to-date.
- [IntelliJ IDEA] + [IntelliJ Rust] and [Toml][IntelliJ Toml] plugins as development environment.
- [rustfmt] for formatting [Rust] code.
- [GNU Make][Make] usage ability for performing commands declared in [`Makefile`].


### Bookshelf

- [Rust Book] teaches and explains [Rust] basics.
- [Rust Reference] is not a formal spec, but is more detailed and comprehensive than the [Rust Book].
- [Rust Standard Library] documentation.
- [Rust Style Guide] is an official style of formatting [Rust] code.
- [Cargo Book] is a guide to [Cargo], [Rust]'s build tool and dependency manager.
- [Rustdoc Book] is a guide to `rustdoc` documentation tool.
- [Rust By Example] teaches you how to program in Rust using editable examples.
- [Rust Cookbook] is a collection of simple examples that demonstrate good practices to accomplish common programming tasks, using the crates of the [Rust] ecosystem.
- [Rust FAQ] answers common question about [Rust].
- [Rust Playground] allows to share and check runnable [Rust] code snippets online.
- [Awesome Rust] is a curated list of Rust code and resources.
- [Baby Steps] blog of [Nicholas Matsakis](https://github.com/nikomatsakis) shares useful [Rust] patterns and ideas.




## Steps

Each step must be performed as separate [MR (Merge Request)][MR] with correspondent name and checked as done after it's completed.
