Step 2.1: Date and time
=======================

[Rust Standard Library] provides a simple [`time`][`std::time`] module which contains basic primitives for time measurements. To operate with dates, time zones, epochs, and other related stuff, [Rust] has the [Chrono] crate.




## Time measurements

To measure a time of some operation, you should not use [Chrono] crate primitives or [`std::time::SystemTime`], but only [`std::time::Instant`] instead, as it provides [monotonic clock][1] measurement (otherwise, your time measurement may be inconsistent).




## Task

Implement a struct `User` with a `birthdate` field, and its methods:
- `age()` which returns current age of user in years;
- `is_adult()` which checks if user is 18 years old at the moment.

Prove your implementation correctness with tests.
